Person.Address								Application.Cities	     
Person.ContactType							Application.Countires
Person.EmailAddress							Application.StateProvinces
Person.Password								Application.People
Person.Person
Person.PersonPhone
Person.StateProvince

Production.Product							Warehouse.StockGroups
Production.ProductCategory						Warehouse.Colors
									Warehouse.StockItems
									Warehouse.StockItemTransaction

email_address nvarchar(256),
username nvarchar(50),
hashedpassword varbinary(max),
phonenumber nvarchar(20) )



DROP TABLE #tempproduct
CREATE TABLE #tempproduct(
